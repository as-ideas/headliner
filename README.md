Headliner is a sequence modeling library that eases the training and **in particular, the deployment of custom sequence models**
for both researchers and developers. You can very easily deploy your models in a few lines of code. It was originally
built for our own research to generate headlines from [Welt news articles](https://www.welt.de/) (see figure 1). That's why we chose the name, Headliner.

## üß† Internals
We use sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) under the hood,
an encoder-decoder framework (see figure 2). We provide a very simple interface to train
and deploy seq2seq models. Although this library was created internally to
generate headlines, you can also use it for **other tasks like machine translations,
text summarization and many more.**

### Why Headliner?

You may ask why another seq2seq library? There are a couple of them out there already.
For example, Facebook has [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq), Google has [seq2seq](https://github.com/google/seq2seq)
and there is also [OpenNMT](http://opennmt.net/).
Although those libraries are great, they have a few drawbacks for our use case e.g. the former doesn't focus much on production
whereas the Google one is not actively maintained. OpenNMT was the closest one to match our requirements i.e.
it has a strong focus on production. However, we didn't like that their workflow
(preparing data, training and evaluation) is mainly done via the command line.
They also expose a well-defined API though but the complexity there is still too high with too much custom code
(see their [minimal transformer training example](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/blob/master/examples/library/minimal_transformer_training.py)).    

Therefore, we built this library for us with the following goals in mind:

* Easy-to-use API for training and deployment (only a few lines of code)
* Uses TensorFlow 2.0 with all its new features (`tf.function`, `tf.keras.layers` etc.)
* Modular classes: text preprocessing, modeling, evaluation
* Extensible for different encoder-decoder models
* Works on large text data

For more details on the library, read the documentation at: [https://as-ideas.github.io/headliner/](https://as-ideas.github.io/headliner/)

Headliner is compatible with Python 3.6 and is distributed under the MIT license.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Before installing Headliner, you need to install TensorFlow as we use this as our deep learning framework. For more
> details on how to install it, have a look at the [TensorFlow installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

Then you can install Headliner itself. There are two ways to install Headliner:

* Install Headliner from PyPI (recommended):

```bash
pip install headliner
```

* Install Headliner from the GitHub source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/as-ideas/headliner.git
cd headliner
python setup.py install
```

## üìñ Usage

### Training
For the training, you need to import one of our provided models or create your own custom one. Then you need to
create the dataset, a `tuple` of input-output sequences, and then train it:

```python
from headliner.trainer import Trainer
from headliner.model.summarizer_transformer import SummarizerTransformer

data = [('You are the stars, earth and sky for me!', 'I love you.'),
        ('You are great, but I have other plans.', 'I like you.')]

summarizer = SummarizerTransformer(embedding_size=64, max_prediction_len=20)
trainer = Trainer(batch_size=2, steps_per_epoch=100)
trainer.train(summarizer, data, num_epochs=2)
summarizer.save('/tmp/summarizer')
```

### Prediction
The prediction can be done in a few lines of code:

```python
from headliner.model.summarizer_transformer import SummarizerTransformer

summarizer = SummarizerTransformer.load('/tmp/summarizer')
summarizer.predict('You are the stars, earth and sky for me!')
```

### Models
Currently available models include a basic encoder-decoder, an encoder-decoder with Luong attention and the transformer:

```python
from headliner.model.summarizer_basic import SummarizerBasic
from headliner.model.summarizer_attention import SummarizerAttention
from headliner.model.summarizer_transformer import SummarizerTransformer

summarizer_basic = SummarizerBasic()
summarizer_attention = SummarizerAttention()
summarizer_transformer = SummarizerTransformer()
```

### Advanced training
Training using a validation split and model checkpointing:

```python
from headliner.model.summarizer_transformer import SummarizerTransformer
from headliner.trainer import Trainer

train_data = [('You are the stars, earth and sky for me!', 'I love you.'),
              ('You are great, but I have other plans.', 'I like you.')]
val_data = [('You are great, but I have other plans.', 'I like you.')]

summarizer = SummarizerTransformer(num_heads=1,
                                   feed_forward_dim=512,
                                   num_layers=1,
                                   embedding_size=64,
                                   max_prediction_len=50)
trainer = Trainer(batch_size=8,
                  steps_per_epoch=50,
                  max_vocab_size_encoder=10000,
                  max_vocab_size_decoder=10000,
                  tensorboard_dir='/tmp/tensorboard',
                  model_save_path='/tmp/summarizer')

trainer.train(summarizer, train_data, val_data=val_data, num_epochs=3)
```

### Advanced prediction
Prediction information such as attention weights and logits can be accessed via predict_vectors returning a dictionary:

```python
from headliner.model.summarizer_transformer import SummarizerTransformer

summarizer = SummarizerTransformer.load('/tmp/summarizer')
summarizer.predict_vectors('You are the stars, earth and sky for me!')
```

### Resume training
A previously trained summarizer can be loaded and then retrained. In this case the data preprocessing and vectorization is loaded from the model.

```python
train_data = [('Some new training data.', 'New data.')] * 10

summarizer_loaded = SummarizerTransformer.load('/tmp/summarizer')
trainer = Trainer(batch_size=2)
trainer.train(summarizer_loaded, train_data)
summarizer_loaded.save('/tmp/summarizer_retrained')
```

### Use pretrained embeddings
Embeddings in GloVe format can be injected in to the trainer as follows. Optionally, set the embedding to non-trainable.

```python
trainer = Trainer(embedding_path_encoder='/tmp/embedding_encoder.txt',
                  embedding_path_decoder='/tmp/embedding_decoder.txt')

# make sure the embedding size matches to the embedding size of the files
summarizer = SummarizerTransformer(embedding_size=64,
                                   embedding_encoder_trainable=False,
                                   embedding_decoder_trainable=False)
```

### Custom preprocessing
A model can be initialized with custom preprocessing and tokenization:

```python
from headliner.preprocessing import Preprocessor

train_data = [('Some inputs.', 'Some outputs.')] * 10

preprocessor = Preprocessor(filter_pattern='',
                            lower_case=True,
                            hash_numbers=False)
train_prep = [preprocessor(t) for t in train_data]
inputs_prep = [t[0] for t in train_prep]
targets_prep = [t[1] for t in train_prep]

# Build tf subword tokenizers. Other custom tokenizers can be implemented
# by subclassing headliner.preprocessing.Tokenizer
from tensorflow_datasets.core.features.text import SubwordTextEncoder
tokenizer_input = SubwordTextEncoder.build_from_corpus(
inputs_prep, target_vocab_size=2**13, reserved_tokens=[preprocessor.start_token, preprocessor.end_token])
tokenizer_target = SubwordTextEncoder.build_from_corpus(
    targets_prep, target_vocab_size=2**13,  reserved_tokens=[preprocessor.start_token, preprocessor.end_token])

vectorizer = Vectorizer(tokenizer_input, tokenizer_target)
summarizer = SummarizerTransformer(embedding_size=64, max_prediction_len=50)
summarizer.init_model(preprocessor, vectorizer)

trainer = Trainer(batch_size=2)
trainer.train(summarizer, train_data, num_epochs=3)
```


### Training on large datasets
Large datasets can be handled by using an iterator:

```python
def read_data_iteratively():
    return (('Some inputs.', 'Some outputs.') for _ in range(1000))

class DataIterator:
    def __iter__(self):
        return read_data_iteratively()

data_iter = DataIterator()

summarizer = SummarizerTransformer(embedding_size=10, max_prediction_len=20)
trainer = Trainer(batch_size=16, steps_per_epoch=1000)
trainer.train(summarizer, data_iter, num_epochs=3)
```
